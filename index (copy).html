    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</p>

    <p id="frm1"><em>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</em></p>
    
    <p>The farmer said,</p>
    
    <p id="chn1"><strong><em>"Maybe"</em></strong>.</p> 
    
    <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p>
    
    <p id="frm2"><em>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</em></p>
      
    <p>The farmer again said,</p>
    
    <p id="chn2"><strong><em>"Maybe"</em></strong>.</p>
      
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p>
    
    <p id="frm3"><em>“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</em></p>
    
    <p>and the farmer responded,</p>
    
    <p id="chn3"><strong><em>"Maybe"</em></strong>. </p>
    
    <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p>
    
    <p id="frm4"><em>“Isn’t that great!”</em></p>
    
    <p>Again, he said,</p>
    
    <p id="chn4"><strong><em>"Maybe"</em></strong>.</p>
      
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span>  — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>
